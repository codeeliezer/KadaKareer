=Fill up the DOH forms provided with dummy data using your or another person's handwriting. Think of what a patient’s records would look like. Give realistic data but avoid providing personal / identifiable information.
	*You can print out the forms, fill it up with a pen, and scan it. This would emulate the real-world scenario of people filling out documents manually.
	*Alternatively, you can save the forms as images and write on those digitally. Use a drawing pad, digipen, or stylus for better results (optional).
	*Typing directly onto the PDF is not allowed. We want to have data representing real-world scenarios.
	*Overall, you will have 6 filled-up forms for your use in the coming weeks. Save them as images or individual PDFs.

Step 2
=Look for a demo on the service’s website. Some have a section where you can upload your image and get the extracted text. Process the forms you’ve filled up through this.

Step 3
=Look at the extracted text on the output file. Compare it side-by-side with the image of your form and determine which characters it got wrong. See if there are patterns that emerge from these errors.

Try this with the other platforms as well. Others might provide different, or even better, results for these types of documents (forms).

Step 4
=Document your process and compile it into a PDF, together with the pre-filled forms and extracted text side-by-side.
